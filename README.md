# WaterMyPlantsKotlin
A Jetpack Compose example using new experimental animations. 

Do you want to use declarative UI like SwiftUI or Flutter, but even more readable and in Kotlin? Well now you can. That's what Jetpack Compose is! 

With Accompanist-Navigation-Animation you can add navigation and box transitions easily. This project uses navigation transitions between the dashboard and
splash screen, and Animated Visibility transitions to change the dashboard content when you change the bottom menu item.

# Generating Data Class From Protobuf lite

Proto provides code generation for interoperable RPC and message opjects that can be passed through gRPC or used directly in your app.

Here, I've defined my plant prototype and used the object type generated to provide a simple list of houseplant objects as a sequence in data/HouseplantData.kt. (The idea is to interface with gRPC data in the next release.)

	syntax = "proto3";
	option java_package = "com.example.watermyplants"; //important. This will be the namespace you use to reference the messages in Kotlin code
	option java_multiple_files = true;
	message Houseplant
	{
    	string name = 1;
    	string status = 2;
    	string imageUrl = 3;
	}
	message Houseplants
	{
    	repeated Houseplant houseplant = 1;
	}
